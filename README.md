# tictactoe
TOP - Tic Tac Toe project

In this project, I will create a browser tic tac toe game that allows the user to choose between two game modes: player vs player OR player vs AI. This project will give me practice in using factory functions and the module pattern when dealing with objects. I have never implemented AI before, so I will also get the chance to learn more about the topic in creating a smart AI for the user to play against.
